## Description

A pattern for creating a custom date picker or polyfill.

## Documentation

This pattern provides a date picker fallback for browsers which don't yet
support the HTML5 date input.

It uses the [Pickaday](https://dbushell.github.io/Pikaday) library.

### Why did we choose Pikaday?

When looking for the underlying library to use for this pattern, we compared
pikaday and [pickadate](https://dbushell.github.io/Pikaday/).

* Prefixed CSS classes

Pikaday's CSS classes are prefixed to make them unique, whereas Pickadate's
classes are very generic and therefore prone to clash with existing classes and CSS in certain sites.

* Better markup

One of the main drawbacks of pickadate is the markup that it produces.
Pickaday's special markup is inserted relative to the input element being overridden.

In contrast, the markup generated by pikaday is appended to the end of the
`<body>` tag, and it then uses absolute positioning to position the picker.

This is easier to style and less prone to create problems when integrating the
picker in diverse styling environments.

* Simpler, more modest featureset and Javascript

Pikaday is only 5KB compressed. The code is AMD aware and easy to read and
understand.
