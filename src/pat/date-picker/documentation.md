## Description

A pattern for creating a datepicker polyfill.

## Documentation

This pattern provides a date picker fallback for browsers which don't yet
support the HTML5 date input.

It uses the [Pickaday](https://dbushell.github.io/Pikaday) library.

### Why did we choose Pikaday?

When looking for the underlying library to use for this pattern, we compared
[pickadate](https://dbushell.github.io/Pikaday/) and [pikaday](https://dbushell.github.io/Pikaday).

One of the main drawbacks of pickadate is the markup that it produces. The CSS
classes are very generic and the special markup is inserted relative to the
input element being overridden. This approach makes styling the picker much more
difficult and makes it harder to integrate the picker into various websites
with very different styles.

In contrast, the markup generated by pikaday is appended to the end of the
`<body>` tag, and then uses absolute positioning to position the picker.
This is a better approach concerning reusability than other pickers which put
their markup in the relative context of the element they're overriding.
